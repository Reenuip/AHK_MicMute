### Hotkey options
| Option            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Passthrough       | If this is turned off, the hotkey will only work for MicMute and will be hidden from the rest of the system.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Wildcard          | If this is turned off, the hotkey will not work if you press extra modifiers. for example if the hotkey is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>M</kbd> and you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>M</kbd> , the hotkey will not be triggered.                                        |
| Neutral modifiers | If this is turned off, the hotkey can have a specific modifier (Right or Left) instead of a neutral one (example: <kbd>RCtrl</kbd> instead of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, this will only be triggered by the right control key). This option should be set *before* recording the hotkey. |
<hr>

### Feedback options
#### 1. Sound feedback
Play a sound when muting/unmuting the microphones.
* You can select which output device to play the sound on.

* You can use custom sounds:
   1. Turn on the option in the config UI
   2. Make sure the sound files (`mp3`,`wav`) are in the same folder as `MicMute.exe`
   3. Rename them as:
        * **Mute sound**: `mute` 

        * **Unmute sound**: `unmute` 

        * **PTT on**: `ptt_on` 

        * **PTT off**: `ptt_off`


#### 2. On-screen feedback
Show an OSD when muting/unmuting the microphones. 

* <details>
  <summary>GIF</summary>

  ![OSD](./screenshots/OSD.gif)
  </details>
* You can change the OSD position (default position is the bottom center of the screen, above the taskbar).
* You can exclude fullscreen apps/games from the OSD, this is needed for some games that lose focus when the OSD is shown.

#### 3. On-screen overlay
Show the microphone's state in an always-on-top overlay.

*  <details>
    <summary>GIF</summary>

    ![overlay](./screenshots/Overlay.gif)
   </details>
* <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>ALT</kbd> <kbd>F9</kbd> toggles show/hide
* <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>ALT</kbd> <kbd>F10</kbd> toggles locked/unlocked 
* You can drag the overlay to change its position when it's unlocked
* Games need to be set to `Windowed fullscreen` or `Borderless` for the overlay to show up on top
* You can set the overlay to only show if the microphone is muted or unmuted
* You can use custom icons for the overlay. 
    To do this, turn on the option in the config UI, then place the icons (`ico`/`png`/`jpeg`) in the same folder as `MicMute.exe` and rename them as:  
    -  Mute icon: `overlay_mute`
    -  Unmute icon: `overlay_unmute`
   
    <sub>**Avoid using icons that have a gray `#232323` color**</sub>
<hr>

### Linked applications
Link a profile to an app/game, when the app becomes visible (not minimized or hidden), MicMute will automatically switch to that profile, when the app is minimized/hidden/closed, MicMute will switch back to the default profile.
<hr>

### Global options
These options are shared between all profiles.
#### 1. Mute on startup
Mute the microphone(s) when starting up or switching profiles.
#### 2. Switching-profile OSD
Show an OSD with the profile's name when switching to it.
#### 3. UI Theme
UI Theme can be set to `System Theme`, `Dark` or `Light`

<small>This does *not* affect the tray icon color, which is always based on the system theme</small>

#### 4. Force Microphone State
Prevent other apps from changing the microphone's state (i.e mute/unmute the microphone).
##### Note: This might break the unmute functionality in some apps, if this happens you'll need to unmute the microphone using MicMute before unmuting inside the app)
<hr>

### Controlling multiple microphones
You can have multiple active hotkeys to control different microphones simultaneously.
To do this, turn on the `Multiple` option then select another microphone from the list and setup hotkeys for it.

When using this feature, the following applies:

* The tray icon will be the static MicMute icon
* The tray icon will no longer act as a toggle button, and the tray menu option to toggle the microphone will be disabled
* The [On-screen feedback](#2-on-screen-feedback) OSD will show the microphone name when muting/unmuting
* The [On-screen overlay](#3-on-screen-overlay) is disabled

#### Alternatively, you can control all the microphones at once with the same hotkey by selecting `All Microphones` from the microphones list. 
When using this feature, the following applies: 
* The `Multiple` option will be disabled
* The [`Force Microphone State`](#4-force-microphone-state) option will be enabled
<hr>

## Known issues
*  [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com) might detect MicMute as a cheat [#59](https://github.com/SaifAqqad/AHK_MicMute/issues/59)
* When running AutoHotkey alongside [Microsoft Powertoys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys), they might conflict with each other, which may result in the hotkeys not working at all. [microsoft/PowerToys#2132](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/2132)

* [Albion Online](https://albiononline.com/en/home) detects MicMute as a botting tool, the games blacklists anything written in autohotkey and marks it as a botting tool. [#23](https://github.com/SaifAqqad/AHK_MicMute/issues/23)

* Windows defender might falsely detect MicMute as a trojen/malware (`Zpevdo.B` or `Wacatac.B!ml`). I always submit new releases to microsoft to remove the false detections and they usually do in a couple of days, but sometimes when they release a new definition update the detection occurs again. [#25](https://github.com/SaifAqqad/AHK_MicMute/issues/25)

## Compile instructions
<small>Note: Run the following commands in powershell, not command prompt.</small>

### 1. Install prerequisites
You'll need [AutoHotkey (Ahk2Exe)](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) in your path.

You can install them using [scoop](https://scoop.sh):

1. Install scoop 
    ```powershell
    # This allows running powershell scripts.
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser;

    # This runs the scoop installer script.
    iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex;
    ```
2. Install prerequisites
    ```powershell
    scoop install git;
    scoop bucket add extras;
    scoop install autohotkey;
    ```
### 2. Clone the repository (and submodules)
    
```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SaifAqqad/AHK_MicMute.git;
cd .\AHK_MicMute\;
```

If you had already cloned the repository without submodules, Run the following command:

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive;
```

### 3. Download and extract BASS library
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "www.un4seen.com/files/bass24.zip" -OutFile ".\bass24.zip";
Expand-Archive ".\bass24.zip" -DestinationPath ".\base24\";
Copy-Item ".\base24\x64\bass.dll" -Destination ".\src\Lib\bass.dll";
```

### 4. Run the compiler

```powershell
ahk2exe.exe /in ".\src\MicMute.ahk" /out ".\src\MicMute.exe";
```
